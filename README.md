# applied-bioinformatics-R-Project

## Purpose
SLE777 Applied Bioinformatics repository to conduct gene analysis, statistical interpretation of tree growth and examination of biological sequence diversity. 

This Project focuses on the use of R and RStudio to demonstrate Applied Bioinformatics priniciples and analysis for a tertiary education assessment.

This public repository is submitted as one of two major components of Assessment 4 - Trimester 2, 2025.

## Structure
There are 3 main topics addressed in this project:

### Part 1
1. Basic mathematical analysis and display of RNAseq count data 
2. Statistical interpretation of tree growth over 20 years

### Part 2
3. Examination of biological sequence diversity
